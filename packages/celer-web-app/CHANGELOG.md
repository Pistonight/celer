## `2.0.0` - `04-16-2022`
- Koroks and Shrines data are now generated by code generator

## `1.6.4` - `03-28-2022`
- fix nonnull assertion bug

## `Experimental`
- `EnhancedScrollTrackerEnabled` - track doc scroll position using line number instead of scroll bar position. There is currently some performance concern with this
- `MapSyncToDocScrollEnabled` - sync map to doc position as you scroll. Currently there is no throttling so this is extremely laggy
- `ExportSplits` - enable the export livesplit splits option. Currently the formatting is hardcoded
- `NoTrackDocPos` - disabling doc pos tracking for performance reasons
- `PigeonMap` - use pigeon map instead of leaflet
