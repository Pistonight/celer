# Welcome to the Celer Wiki
Celer is a route engine for BOTW with features designed to make it easier to maintain the route.

The features include
- Automatically count Koroks, Shrines, etc.
- Internal variable management, such as counting rushrooms or tails
- Champion ability validation, such as checking if the ability has recharged
- Generating `.lss` split file for livesplit
- Viewing the route doc side-by-side with a map
- Generating objmap file

Essentially, celer allows router maintainer to make route changes without doing the boring book-keeping. If you are tired of updating hundreds of korok numbers when making changes, celer is for you.
